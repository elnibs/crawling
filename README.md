crawling
========

Various codes used between crawljax (https://github.com/crawljax) and Apache Nutch (https://nutch.apache.org/)

mainly Nutch 1.7 and Crawljax 3.4

The main class is core.GoogleCrawler and what it basically does is make a search targetting Google and fetch the url results.

Note: this is just a testing code and nothing to work directly with as it is against Google's Terms and Conditions so I just used it as an exercise for testing the Crawljax api on something else than their demo website.
